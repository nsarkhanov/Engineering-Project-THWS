# Download und Initalisierung

This code is written with Angular in a specific version. Therefore it is very important to update the package.json file on each computer to ensure the running of the file. 

After downloading and opening the file in your editor, open a terminal and directly navigate into the complete file strutctur. By typing ls you should see the the package.json-file. If this is the case you can type in the following commands:

sudo npm i -g npm-check-updates && ncu -u && npm i

npm update

Afterwards everything should work fine and you can start working on your feature. 

Have fun!
